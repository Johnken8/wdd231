### Key Components

#### 1. Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with breakpoints at 600px and 900px
- Fluid grid layout that changes from single column (mobile) to multi-column (tablet/desktop)
- Responsive images with `<picture>` element and `srcset` attributes

#### 2. Header and Navigation
- Chamber logo and name
- Social media links
- Responsive hamburger menu (mobile) that converts to horizontal navigation bar (desktop)
- Current date display banner

#### 3. Hero Section
- Responsive hero image with overlay text
- Call-to-action button linking to join page

#### 4. Main Content Grid
The main content grid includes:
- Event announcement section
- Weather section with API integration
- News release section
- Join section with button
- Business spotlights section with randomly selected gold/silver members

#### 5. Weather API Integration
- Uses OpenWeatherMap API to display current weather
- Shows temperature, weather description, and icon
- Includes a 3-day forecast as required
- Includes fallback mock data when API key isn't available

#### 6. Business Spotlights
- Displays 2-3 random gold or silver member businesses
- Loads information from JSON data
- Displays company name, logo, contact information, and membership level
- Randomly changes on each page load

#### 7. Footer
- Chamber contact information
- Location map link
- Copyright information with dynamic year
- Last modified date

## How to Customize

1. **API Key**: Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `weather.js` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.

2. **Chamber Information**: Update the chamber name, logo, contact details, etc., throughout the HTML to match your chosen Chamber of Commerce.

3. **Member Data**: Update the `members.json` file with actual member information for your chamber.

4. **Images**: Replace placeholder images with actual chamber logo, hero image, and member logos.

5. **Colors and Typography**: The color scheme uses CSS variables in the `:root` section of `base.css`. You can modify these to match your chamber's branding.

## Implementation Notes

### JSON Data Source
The project uses a JSON file to store member data which is then used for the spotlights feature. The JavaScript code filters this data for gold and silver members and randomly selects 2-3 to display on each page load.

### Weather API
The weather component uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data. For development purposes, mock data is included when an API key isn't available.

### Responsive Navigation
The navigation menu uses JavaScript to toggle between mobile (hamburger) and desktop views.

### Performance Considerations
- Images are optimized using WebP format
- CSS is split into multiple files loaded only when needed (media queries)
- JavaScript is modular and loaded with the defer attribute
